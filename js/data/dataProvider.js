Spatial data management is more direct than query-by-example, which is more direct than SEQUEL. Computer arcade games and Visicalc are further examples.Direct manipulation involves three interrelated techniques:1. Provide a physically direct way of moving a cursor or manipulating the objects of interest.2.

In many cases they deal with thousands of records. While previous research has focused on searching and browsing, overview tasks are often overlooked. We introduce a novel interactive visual overview of event sequences called \\emph{LifeFlow}. LifeFlow is scalable, can summarize all possible sequences, and represents the temporal spacing of the events within sequences. Two case studies with healthcare and transportation domain experts are presented to illustrate the usefulness of LifeFlow. A user study with ten participants confirmed that after 15 minutes of training novice users were able to rapidly answer questions about the prevalence and temporal characteristics of sequences, find anomalies, and gain significant insight from the data.","drill_2":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1979196","cat_1":["Krist Wongsuphasawat","John Alexis Guerra Gómez","Catherine Plaisant","Taowei David Wang","Meirav Taieb-Maimon","Ben Shneiderman"],"cat_2":["information visualization","overview visualization","temporal categorical data","timestamped event sequences"],"drill_1":"Aigner, W., and Miksch, S.

These powerful social issues introduce a need for scientific research into technology mediated social participation. What are the actual, tangible benefits of \"greening\" Twitter profile pictures in support of the Iranian elections? Does cartooning a Facebook profile picture really raise awareness of child abuse? Are there unintended negative effects through low-risk, low-cost technology-mediated participation? And, is there a difference - in both outcome and engagement level - between different types of online social activism?

The structured replicated case studies show that the integrated approach in SocialAction<\/i> led to significant discoveries by a political analyst, a bibliometrician, a healthcare consultant, and a counter-terrorism researcher.

Display of patient histories aligned on sentinel events (such as a first heart attack) enables users to spot precursor, co-occurring, and aftereffect events. A controlled study demonstrates the benefits of providing alignment (with a 61% speed improvement for complex tasks).

Visibility of national and international priorities such as public health, political unrest, disaster relief, and climate change has increased, yet we know little about the benefits - and possible costs - of engaging in social activism via social media. These powerful social issues introduce a need for scientific research into technology mediated social participation. What are the actual, tangible benefits of \"greening\" Twitter profile pictures in support of the Iranian elections? Does cartooning a Facebook profile picture really raise awareness of child abuse? Are there unintended negative effects through low-risk, low-cost technology-mediated participation? And, is there a difference - in both outcome and engagement level - between different types of online social activism? This SIG will investigate technology mediated social participation through a critical lens, discussing both the potential positive and negative outcomes of such participation. Approaches to designing for increased participation, evaluating effects of participation, and next steps in scientific research directions will be discussed.","drill_2":"http:\/\/portal.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1979543","cat_1":["Dana Rotman","Sarah Vieweg","Sarita Yardi","Ed Chi","Jenny Preece","Ben Shneiderman","Peter Pirolli","Tom Glaisyer"],"cat_2":["activism","change","design","participation","slacktivism","social media"],"drill_1":"Batson, C.

In many cases they deal with thousands of records. While previous research has focused on searching and browsing, overview tasks are often overlooked. We introduce a novel interactive visual overview of event sequences called LifeFlow. LifeFlow is scalable, can summarize all possible sequences, and represents the temporal spacing of the events within sequences. In this video, we show an example of patient transfer data and briefly demonstrate how to analyze them with LifeFlow.
